# Metis

Tourette Syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder that begins in childhood or adolescence. It is characterized by multiple motor and vocal tics. Common tics are blinking, coughing, throat clearing, sniffing, and other facial movements. The tics often go unnoticed by casual observers.

As for today, there is no known way for quantifying the percentage of functionality among people who have this disorder.
This need ignited the birth of ‘Metis’, an application for data gathering about young Tourette Syndrome patients.

The project is led by Professor Izhar Bar-Gad and Yocheved Loewenstern of the ‘Gonda multidisciplinary brain research and studies center’ in Bar-Ilan University.
The application includes games and videos for the experiments and the patients engages with them while the data is gathered on the fly. The list of wanted sensors for each patient is decided by the researcher and a video of the patient is being recorded for each session. After the data is gathered by the application, it will be analyzed by the researchers in order to quantify the level of the disorder. The end goal is to have scaling of the syndrome.

Disclosure: The goal of the application is experimental and therefore it should not be used without a dedicated researcher who knows the legal limitations and the procedure of the experiment it was invented for.
